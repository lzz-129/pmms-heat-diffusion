This folder contains the reference sequential implementation 
of the heat diffusion assigment 1 for the PMMS class.

This folder contains three files:
- Makefile
- ref1.c
- ref2.c

To compile the reference code be sure to have a vanilla version
of the heat diffusion framework, i.e. clone a new project from 
the repo:
git clone git@github.com:giuliostramondo/pmms-heat-diffusion.git

Copy the three files contained in this folder inside the folder
pmms-heat-diffusion/assignment_1/heat_seq. 
Note: this will replace the current Makefile.

Now you can compile the reference code from the heat_seq folder
running the command "make".
